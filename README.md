# JVEsuite by JVEsoft
End of Live

Sadly, I must say that piracy won.

I am hereby officially ending support for the JVEsuite. I thank all the people who purchased the suite and I hope that it was worth your while. I will refund the three (!) people who purchased the suite in the last half a year, as I feel that would be fair.

The code is now freely available here for whoever wants to pick it up, support and update it. You are welcomed to take over.

It was nice while it lasted. Alas, it’s over.

Good bye!
Yegor
